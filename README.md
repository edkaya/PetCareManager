# Pet Care Manager
An iOS App called Pet Care Manager where pet owners can store relevant information about their pets.

# Problem Statement
Many pet owners may face several problems while taking care of their animals. It is important to be aware of the health status of their pets, monitor their nutrition and activities, and organize their future appointments in a systematic manner.<br/>
To solve these challenges and minimize their negative effects, I need an iOS application called Pet Care Manager. This application should allow me to track my pet's health records. When I click on the health records, it should show which vaccinations the animal has received and which illnesses/operations it has undergone.<br/>
Additionally, the app should show the upcoming appointments if it is needed for the pet.<br/>
Besides that, the app should allow me to track the medications that the pet uses. In addition to the medications, I should also prepare a daily list of meals that the pet needs to consume. The app should additionally show me a random dog photo or video every time I click a button.<br/>
In summary, I need an iOS app that will allow me to track my pet's daily consumption, health status, and further appointments.<br/>
